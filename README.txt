A Python program for the iRobot Create that emulates a patrol AI in games, using OpenCV for the webcam capture, image processing, color processing, and other computer vision aspects. Essentially, the robot will patrol between two differently-colored patrol nodes until it sees an enemy of a certain color, then it will deviate from its patrol path to bump into (a.k.a., “kill”) the enemy before returning to its patrol path. Relies on the create.py file, which contains the iRobot Create API.
